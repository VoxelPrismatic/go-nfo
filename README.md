# go-nfo
An NFO editor (for Jellyfin) using Qt, built in Go.

## why?
1. I'm too familiar with Python
2. I will avoid electron like the plague
3. It's a fantastic learning opportunity

## goals
- Should be easily understood; no instruction manual necessary
- Actors, Actresses & other people should have their picture easily editable
- Since this is for Jellyfin, I want to make it easy to customize pictures & banners
- The Qt portion should be built on top of the NFO module, not with

## roadmap
- [ ] basic models & classes
- [ ] nfo editor
- [ ] nfo build to xml
- [ ] nfo parse xml
- [ ] ui biz
